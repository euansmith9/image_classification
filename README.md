# image_classification
Built and compared two deep learning models, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT), to classify images. The project involved designing and implementing both architectures in PyTorch, training them on labelled image data, and evaluating performance using accuracy and loss metrics.
